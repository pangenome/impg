# Three-path SNP bubble

- Fixture ID: `snp_bubble_3path`
- Class: `snp_bubble`
- Tier: `ci`
- Assertion: `single_ordered_snp_bubble`
- Known failure mode: Branch path spellings get swapped or the SNP remains as path-specific singleton nodes.
- Render status: skipped for fast profile rows; reason `render_tool_not_configured_for_fast_profile`.
- Method status counts: pass=12
